model 0:
	- trained with max_torque = 3 and max_velocity = 50
	- trained on model with friction and delay (0.05)
	- score 0.502
	- evaluation number 136
	- obtained by just penalising more the velocities in the stabilisation region

model 1:
	- same as 0, but obtained at evaluation step number 176
	- socre 0.44
	- worth trying, as it has seen more dynamics so it may be more robust
